			"postcontent":"<h3>A change of place</h3><p>On May 21 2016, on the day of my birthday, I moved from my rented accomodation to a sublet apartment in the campus for the summer. I celebrated my birthday with some of the students staying on campus. For celebrations I gave a treat of pizza and cake (Tres Leches). </p><h3>A Summer job</h3><p>I worked at the Music Library and performed tasks like checking books in/out, shelf reading, and shelving. Shelving is quite intense considering the thin books in the Music Library which are difficult to locate in the correct location due to the abundance of the thin books in this library (music scores). I really learned to appreciate the work that the librarians do</p><h3>A long Drive</h3><p>On May 30, 2016, I drove from my new house to my old workpace which was 1000 miles away in Kennesaw, Georgia. I met old colleagues, old bosses, got my car license plates renewed, played football and spent some time with friends. On the way back I took the scenic route through North Georgia, and North Carolina, driving across the scenic Appalachian mountains. </p><h3>Summer Project</h3><p>I started work under my professor for the summer project which concerns with parsing of medical reports to present comorbidities from the impressions and findings so that the doctors can confirm the same. </p><h3>Body Training</h3><p>I started on an endeavour to be more healthy and lean. I started jogging. I reached the person best jogging distance of 11 miles and hope that I will be able to job for atleast 15 miles before the summer is over.</p>",
