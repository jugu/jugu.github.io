            A patient is readmitted to hospital complaining about certain symptoms. 
            <br/>
            The patient mentions the medications he/she has been taking as prescribed previously.
            <br/>
            The doctor goes through the prescribed medicine and correlates them with the symptoms to determine what caused the side effects.
            <br/>
            <b>There can be many symptoms that can be attributed to a drug's side effects. Many drugs may give the same side effect, or a combination of the drugs may lead to the side effect. Sometimes the dosages of medications may also lead to the side effects.</b>
            <br/>
            This becomes an ardous task for the doctor to determine which medication(s) is/are the prominent cause of the side effects reported by the patient.
            <br/>
            <b>How do we quickly determine which medication is the culprit?</b>
