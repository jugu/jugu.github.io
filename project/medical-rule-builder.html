            <span style='color:magenta'>Dr. Strange (aka doctor)</span>: "Hmm! Let me perform a general health checkup"<br/>            
            <span style='color:blue'>Patient</span>: "OK Doctor!"<br/>
            <span style='color:magenta'>Doctor</span>: "I will examine your vital physical parameters and then your blood/urine/stool samples will be collected and sent to lab for testing"<br/>    
            <span style='color:blue'>Patient</span>: "Fine Doctor!"<br/>
            Some time later....<br/>
            <span style='color:magenta'>Doctor</span>: I have got your lab reports. Now let' see what we have here....hmmm! It is not looking good!<br/>
            <span style='color:green'>Nurse</span>: Doctor! Few more patients have come now and they need your service quickly.<br/>
            <span style='color:magenta'>Doctor (to the patient)</span>:  Aargh! I wish there was an easier way to diagnose you. It will take me some time to figure out the causes for your illness because I have to go through many combinations of your clinical values and some of the disease detection rules have CHANGED <br/>
            <span style='color:magenta'>Doctor</span>:<b> I wish there was an easy way to create/change/apply these rules so that I can focus on confirming the illnesses! It will save me a ton of time!</b>

            <p>I created a rule builder interface which would allow the doctors/administrators to add or modify rules for computing comorbidities. The modified rules can then be applied to the clinically reported values and a list of comorbidities can be hinted for the patient. The doctor can then reconcile with the hinted comorbidity and finalize them as part of the workflow for reporting comorbidities.
